## Phase 2: Deep Learning Progression & Model Benchmarking

| Day / Milestone | Model Architecture | Accuracy | Recall (Churn=1) | Precision (Churn=1) | ROC-AUC | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | Baseline Logistic Regression | 0.8053 | 0.5722 | 0.6544 | 0.8361 | Deprecated |
| **Day 2** | Decision Tree / Random Forest / SVM | 0.7854 | 0.7567 | 0.5739 | 0.8491 | Evaluated |
| **Day 3** | Tuned Random Forest (5-Fold CV) | 0.7925 | 0.7701 | 0.5842 | 0.8498 | Audited |
| **Day 4** | **Domain Features + Ensembles (XGBoost)** | **0.8010** | **0.8048** | **0.5960** | **0.8612** | **Production Champion** |
| **Day 5** | Deep ANN (Keras 3-Layer + BatchNorm + Dropout) | 0.7583 | 0.7834 | 0.5288 | 0.8415 | DL Benchmark |

### Honest Diagnostic: When to Use Which?
1. **Classical Ensembles (XGBoost / Random Forest) — The Clear Winner on Tabular Data**:
   - **Why XGBoost Remains Production Champion**: On medium-sized tabular retail records (~7,000 rows), gradient boosted decision trees naturally handle mixed feature distributions, discrete boundaries, and non-linear interactions without requiring heavy parameter search or architectural tuning. XGBoost delivered higher ROC-AUC (**0.8612** vs. **0.8415**) and significantly better precision with zero risk of gradient vanishing.
   - **Operational Footprint**: Near-instant inference latency, minimal memory usage, and no native GPU runtime dependency.

2. **Deep Learning (Keras Feed-Forward ANN) — When Depth Actually Adds Value**:
   - **Observations on Tabular Telco**: The deep ANN learned meaningful decision surfaces and high churn recall (**0.7834**), but required aggressive regularization (Dropout, BatchNormalization, EarlyStopping) to prevent overfitting tabular noise.
   - **When to Deploy Neural Nets in RetailMind AI**:
     - High-cardinality entity embeddings (e.g., millions of customer IDs or SKU categories).
     - Multi-modal retail data (e.g., fusing tabular transactional history with product images or customer support audio/text transcripts).
     - Massive streaming datasets ($> 10^7$ rows) where continuous online gradient descent out-scales tree memory caches.
